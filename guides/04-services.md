# Services Documentation

## Overview

The services layer implements the core business logic of the Agrotrade system, handling authentication, user management, marketplace operations, order processing, escrow payments, and in-app messaging. Real-time features (chat, order status, notifications) are powered by Firebase.

## Core Services

### 1. Authentication & User Service (`auth.py`, `users.py`)
- Multi-role authentication (Consumer, Farmer, Agribusiness)
- JWT/OAuth authentication
- User registration and profile management
- Role management
- Account status management

### 2. Marketplace Service (`marketplace.py`)
- Product listing creation, update, and deletion (CRUD)
- Product filtering (location, price, quantity)
- Product image upload and management
- Farmer dashboard (listings, sales, revenue)

### 3. Order & Cart Service (`orders.py`, `cart.py`)
- Order placement and status tracking
- Cart management for consumers
- Order status updates (pending, paid, delivered, released, cancelled)
- Farmer and consumer order dashboards
- Syncs order status with Firebase for real-time updates

### 4. Payment & Escrow Service (`payments.py`)
- Escrow-based payment processing (blockchain integration)
- Payment gateway integration
- Fund release upon delivery confirmation
- Transaction status tracking

### 5. Firebase Service (`firebase/`)
- Real-time chat between users
- Real-time order status updates
- Real-time notifications
- Syncs with backend for consistency and analytics

### 6. Messaging & Notification Service (`messaging.py`, `notifications.py`)
- In-app chat between buyers and sellers (powered by Firebase)
- Order-related notifications (via Firebase)
- Status updates and alerts (via Firebase)

## Service Dependencies
- Repository layer for data access (users, products, orders, messages)
- Blockchain/Web3 service for escrow
- Firebase for real-time features
- External services: Email, logging, cache

## Error Handling
- Authentication errors (invalid credentials, expired tokens)
- Marketplace errors (invalid product, permission denied)
- Order/payment errors (insufficient funds, escrow issues)
- Messaging errors (delivery failures)
- Firebase sync errors

## Security Measures
- Secure password hashing
- JWT encryption and expiration
- Role-based access control
- Escrow transaction validation
- Data encryption and audit logging
- Firebase security rules for real-time data

## Performance Considerations
- Caching for product listings and user data
- Efficient database queries and connection pooling
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Firebase usage monitoring

## Testing
- Unit and integration tests for all services
- End-to-end flow testing (order, payment, messaging)
- Security and error handling tests
- Firebase integration tests

## Monitoring and Logging
- Performance monitoring (response times, transaction times)
- Security and audit logging (authentication, payments, Firebase events)
- Error and event logging (order failures, chat issues, Firebase sync)
